# Day-Planner-05

--- On this assignment, we had to create a calendar that displays what time it currently is
    between 9am and 5pm (business standard time). When text is added into one of the time blocks
    and the save button is clicked, the information is stored in local storage and displayed to
    the index homepage. I enjoyed this project in all honesty, despite the challenge. JQuery and
    Bootstrap FTW. ---

index.html - 
----------
* Add Bootstrap timeblocks. 

* Used CSS properties and added them as classes.

style.css - 
---------
* Changed the colors for the past, present, and future (I thought mine worked nicer for me).

* Didn't change much else, as most of it was predefined.

script.js - 
---------
* Added a lot of jQuery (works so much better).
* Used jQuery to add the predefined color coded properties.
* GET AND SET to save and display text to local storage and the index screen.
